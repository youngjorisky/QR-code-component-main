## My process
-Involed basically using css flex property to create two containers and putting an img tag into one and the texts tag into the other. Styling was essential to archieving my desired results.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font style.

### What I learned

Learnt the 'object-fit: cover' property and utilized the max-width property to prevent unorganised text and img layouts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  object-fit: cover;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development

Looks much simpler so i am yearning to solve more complex programs with the same language at a much faster rate.

### Useful resources
